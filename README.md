## <a name="no-link"></a>Technologies Used

- **Next.js**

Next.js is a React framework for building modern web applications. It provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, resulting in faster page loads and improved SEO. Next.js simplifies the development process and offers features like automatic code splitting, routing, and hot module replacement.

- **Three.js**

Three.js is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. It provides a higher-level abstraction for building interactive 3D experiences. It offers a variety of controls, geometries, materials, and lights, adding a 3D layer of interactivity and visual appeal.

- **TypeScript**

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability. It allows us to catch errors during development and provides better tooling support, leading to more robust applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development. Its utility classes make it easy to create responsive and custom-designed user interfaces without writing custom CSS.
